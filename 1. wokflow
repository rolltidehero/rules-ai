## 1. Workflow & docs

- **`changelog.md`**
    
    - Append time-stamped entries for every meaningful change/decision; never overwrite.
        
    - Each entry: what changed, why, implications, and key lessons after milestones.
        
- **`suggestions.md`**
    
    - Append-only, structured into:
        
        - Frontend
            
        - Backend
            
        - Other/Trending
            
    - Every response adds **15 suggestions**: 5 frontend, 5 backend, 5 other/trending.
        
- **`components.md`**
    
    - Maintain a Markdown table: name, usage location, source/library, brief description.
        
    - When code exists, inspect it and document all implemented components.
        
- **`todo.md`**
    
    - Single Markdown checklist of all tasks.
        
    - `[x]` for done, `[ ]` for pending; always kept current and comprehensive.
        
- **Error handling**
    
    - Every session includes an error/consistency pass before finishing.
        
    - Parsing, sync, and DOM logic must be validated and logged via a dedicated error logger.
